Step by step Amazing Events

You’ll find here the steps to complete your first sprint.
With each sprint you’ll be progressively adding functionality to the site.

❗Remember that the style and palette of the site is up to you and that you can make any changes you want in design (as long as the content remains complete).

For your first sprint you’ll need your knowledge in HTML & CSS, in addition to Bootstrap.

1st Sprint

◾You’ll create 6 html files for:
-Home
-Past Events
-Upcoming Events
-Contact
-Stats
-Details

◾Assign a corresponding “title” to each of the pages and add a favicon to each html

◾Remember when creating the site that the Details page won't be a part of the navbar, instead each event card must take you to it.

◾Complete each page with its content (as shown in the wireframe)

◾You can style your page with your personal CSS file, Bootstrap or a combination of both.
(TIP: if you use Bootstrap make sure that the document maintains the correct semantic)

◾Once you’re done, create a repository in GitHub “AmazingEvents(Name)LastName”

◾Connect your project with the repository

◾Add your files to the staging area (git add . or git add file-name)

◾Add them to your local repository (git commit –m “description”)

◾Add them to your remote repository (git push origin nameOfBranch)

◾Submit your sprint leaving the link to your GitHub repository.
